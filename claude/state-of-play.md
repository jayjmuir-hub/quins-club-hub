# State of play

**Reading-order step 3.** Where things stand TODAY and what is blocked on whom.
Restarted from scratch 14 Aug 2026 — the previous edition reached 2,151 lines
because every correction was appended instead of replacing anything, and half of
it was dated narrative about its own past.

## ⚠️ The rule that keeps this file useful

**Nothing dated goes in here. If it will be wrong in a week, it does not belong.**

- **A fact about the CODEBASE** → `RESTORE.md`.
- **Why a question was settled** → `claude/decisions/`.
- **What changed and when** → `claude/changelog.md`.
- **Known-broken but not blocking** → `claude/open-items.md`.
- **What a session did** → `claude/handoffs/`.

**Never quote a number a query can produce.** Every wrong claim in this file's
history was a rotted measurement; the rulings never rotted. Measure it.

⚠️ **If this file passes ~80 lines, something dated has crept in. Cut it.**

## Where things stand

**Live at https://adhquins-clubhub.com with real families on it.** The club went
live 13 Aug 2026. Assume a real parent is looking at whatever you touch.

**Current phase: onboarding, and the fixes it throws up.** Not new
infrastructure. The last four features found their bugs within hours of a real
person using them, and none of those bugs had a failing test.

## Blocked on Jay

- **Leaked-password protection is OFF** — Supabase → Authentication → Policies.
- **Most squads have nobody attached on `/admin/staff`**, so the Home "Squad
  contacts" card shows its empty state to most of the club. Data entry, not code.
  Run the query below rather than trusting this sentence.
- **No monitoring exists at all.** An uptime check and a Sentry account are both
  account creations, so they are his. See `claude/open-items.md`.

## Tabled — do not start, do not offer, do not ask again

The photo **restore drill**, the **AI build**
(`claude/plans/2026-08-12-ai-integration.md`), and **training session plans**.
Jay reopens them or they stay closed. ⚠️ The AI *ruling* — children's data may
leave the club, minimised — still stands and still governs;
`claude/decisions/2026-08-12-childrens-data-may-leave-the-club.md`.

## Numbers — measure, never cite

```sql
-- the club, right now
select (select count(*) from auth.users)                                as logins,
       (select count(distinct profile_id) from memberships
         where status = 'active')                                       as members,
       (select count(*) from players)                                   as players,
       (select count(*) from memberships where status = 'pending')      as awaiting_approval,
       (select count(*) from memberships where is_super)                as super_admins,
       (select count(*) from storage.objects
         where bucket_id = 'player-photos')                             as player_photos;

-- squads with nobody looking after them
select t.name from teams t where not exists (
  select 1 from memberships m where m.team_id = t.id and m.status = 'active'
    and m.role in ('coach','manager','medic','admin')) order by t.sort_order;
```

## Test data still in the live database

A seeded September, all carrying one `group_id`:
`delete from events where group_id = '5eed0000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001';`
⚠️ **"Seeded" does not mean safe to modify** — a real completed match sheet hangs
off one of those fixtures. Select a test row by its id after looking at it, never
by the group.
